# Simple Profiler

Simple profile is a small tool to be used to profile any C++ application. Simple Profile comes with two parts, the first being the recording code which is used to profile an app, and the second is a visual tool which is used to show the performance.

# Timeline
This app will display a timeline. The timeline is an overview of the application which has been profiled. This view will show any function profiled, and it's corresponding time taken.

# Stack trace
This app will display a stack trace below the timeline. This trace is populated when a result on the timeline has been selected.
